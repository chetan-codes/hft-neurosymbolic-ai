# HFT Neurosymbolic AI – Roadmap

## 📚 Terminology & Definitions

This section explains key concepts in simple terms for the general public to understand our project.

### **HFT (High-Frequency Trading)**
- **What it is**: A type of trading where computers make thousands of buy/sell decisions per second
- **Why it matters**: Speed and precision can lead to better profits, but also higher risks
- **Our approach**: Using AI to make smarter, safer decisions instead of just faster ones

### **Neurosymbolic AI**
- **What it is**: Combining two types of AI: neural networks (like ChatGPT) + symbolic reasoning (like human logic)
- **Neural networks**: Learn patterns from data (e.g., "when prices go up, volume usually increases")
- **Symbolic reasoning**: Apply logical rules (e.g., "if confidence < 70%, don't trade")
- **Why combine them**: Neural networks find patterns, symbolic reasoning ensures safety and explainability

### **Market Regimes**
- **What it is**: Different "moods" of the market that require different trading strategies
- **Examples**:
  - **Trending Bull**: Market going up strongly (good time to buy)
  - **Trending Bear**: Market going down strongly (good time to sell or wait)
  - **Sideways Volatile**: Market moving sideways with big swings (risky, need careful timing)
  - **Low Volatility**: Market barely moving (good time to wait for opportunities)

### **Technical Signals**
- **What it is**: Mathematical indicators that help predict price movements
- **Moving Averages**: Average price over time (e.g., 20-day vs 50-day average)
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Measures if a stock is "overbought" (>70) or "oversold" (<30)
- **Volume Analysis**: How much trading activity is happening (high volume often confirms price moves)

### **Risk Assessment**
- **What it is**: Evaluating how much money you could lose and setting safety limits
- **Position Sizing**: How much of your portfolio to invest in one trade (usually 2-10%)
- **Stop Loss**: Automatic sell order if price drops too much (like a safety net)
- **Correlation Risk**: Avoiding putting too much money in similar investments

### **Compliance Rules**
- **What it is**: Safety rules to prevent illegal or dangerous trading
- **Trading Hours**: When you can and cannot trade (markets have specific hours)
- **Position Limits**: Maximum amount you can invest in one stock or sector
- **Restricted Securities**: Stocks you cannot trade during certain periods (like earnings announcements)

### **RDF Triples**
- **What it is**: A way to store information as "subject-predicate-object" relationships
- **Example**: "AAPL (Apple) - has_price - $150" or "AAPL - trades_on - NASDAQ"
- **Why use them**: Easy to query complex relationships and find patterns across data

### **Graph Databases**
- **What it is**: Databases designed to store and query relationships between things
- **Dgraph**: Fast database for RDF triples (our main data store)
- **Neo4j**: Database for property graphs (good for complex trading relationships)
- **Why use them**: Can quickly find connections like "which stocks move together?"

### **Prometheus Metrics**
- **What it is**: System for monitoring performance and health in real-time
- **Examples**: How many trades per second, response time, error rates
- **Why important**: Helps us spot problems before they become serious
